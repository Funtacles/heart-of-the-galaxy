		This area of the bat caverns is home to the staircase that leads back up to Submission. A wooden sign next to the staircase warns any traveller against consuming the mushrooms found in certain parts of the caverns. A picture of some glowing blue mushrooms is displayed next to this warning, and beneath that, there's some information that identifies this particular fungi to be an exception. Apparently, it's the only edible type of mushroom that grows down here, and is highly sought-after by the slimes which inhabit these caverns. Apparently, eating these mushrooms has caused the slimes down here to glow, and also causes them to experience psychedelic effects, which makes their behaviour highly unpredictable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking up towards the top of the staircase, you see the relatively bright lighting of Submission's tunnels shining down to illuminate the top dozen or so steps.
		 Perhaps because of that ever-present source of light, this area seems entirely deserted...

		The thick, inky blackness of the bat caverns is kept at bay by the softly glowing moss beneath your feet. With every step, a new pool of the low light blooms outward as the previous one fades, allowing you to see out to roughly fifteen metres all around you. Above your head, the cavern's roof is so high that all you can see is a blanket of completely impenetrable darkness. Occasionally you think you hear a sound, a high-pitched keening, from somewhere up there, but you try not to think too hard about it.
	</p>
	<p>
		There's an ever-present dripping sound that echoes from everywhere and nowhere, giving the caverns its own ambient, if unfocused, melody. The air is also surprisingly fresh, clean and cool; not at all what you'd expect from a typical cave. Indeed, the fresh air down here is certainly chilly enough to raise goosebumps on any exposed skin and harden nipples beneath clothing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You weave through clusters of stalagmites as you proceed forwards through the darkness, reaching out to use the smooth, cool stone for support as you step over little streams and narrow cracks in the floor.

		Compared to the majority of the bat caverns, the area you find yourself standing in is lit up like a beacon. The moss carpet beneath your feet thrives in amongst bioluminescent fungi of all shapes, sizes, and colours, and forms trailing little paths that wind through the area. While some of these mushroom-like plants approach the height of trees, the vast majority are no more than twenty-or-so centimetres tall. Pools of still, shallow water are to be found scattered throughout the floor of this underground forest, and by reflecting the many hues of light from the surrounding flora, they give this place an unearthly, almost ethereal ambiance.
	</p>
	<p>
		The luminescence given off by the fungi is bright enough to reveal just how colossal these caves are. The tips of stalactites, illuminated by the taller of the tree-sized mushrooms, look to be almost a hundred metres above your head, while the base where they connect to the ceiling, still shrouded in darkness, is significantly higher even than that. Some of the largest of these spires have points of light shining out from them, and you realise that you're looking upon the carved-out windows of bat-morphs' roosts.

		Just like the dark parts of the caverns, there's an ever-present dripping sound that echoes from everywhere and nowhere, producing an ambient, if unfocused, melody. The air is also surprisingly fresh, clean and cool; not at all what you'd expect from a typical cave. Indeed, the fresh air down here is certainly chilly enough to raise goosebumps on any exposed skin and harden nipples beneath clothing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite the fact that this area is well illuminated, there are enough of the tree-sized mushrooms present to provide any would-be attacker with a convenient hiding place...

	<p>
		A slow-moving underground river carves its way through the bat caverns, and it's beside this body of water that you find yourself travelling. While the river's surface is illuminated by the bioluminescent lichen, the light is too dim to penetrate the cool, dark depths, and you wonder what sort of creatures, if any, would call such an inhospitable place home.
	</p>
	<p>
		The air in this part of the caverns is particularly fresh and cool, and you feel a slight breeze blowing over the exposed parts of your body. Perhaps due to the immediate proximity of such a large body of water, the dripping sounds that are found all throughout the caverns are particularly loud here, and you often find yourself turning around to check that nobody's using the noise to mask their approach...

		A slow-moving underground river carves its way through the bat caverns, and it's beside this body of water that you find yourself travelling. While the river's surface is illuminated by the bioluminescent lichen, the light is too dim to penetrate the cool, dark depths, and you wonder what sort of creatures, if any, would call such an inhospitable place home.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before you, small patches of glowing turquoise fungi grow along both sides of the river's sheer banks. A pair of tree-sized bioluminescent mushrooms grow out from the middle of these patches, and have been shaped into a horizontal, weaving pattern by the residents of these caverns in order to form a living bridge across the water's dark depths.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stepping up to this fascinating structure, you see that planks of wood have been tied to the mushrooms' stalks in order to provide sturdy footing. Rope-netting has also been cunningly erected to either side, making this bridge a very safe way to get to the path on the other side.

	</p>
	<p>
		The cavern's roof slopes down before you, and the path that you were walking on suddenly comes to an abrupt halt as it meets a solid wall of stone. The river to your side drops away into a pitch-black abyss, and by the light of the lichen underfoot, you see that a finely meshed metal grate has been built to save anyone from being swept down into the bottomless depths below.
	</p>
	<p>
		With no way forwards, you'll have to turn around and double-back on yourself...

		Although there's no shortage of bioluminescent fungi in this area, you can tell that the vast majority of it is poisonous, and is clearly unsuitable for consumption. As you walk past a particularly large mushroom-tree, however, you see a little cluster of glowing blue mushrooms that look to be quite different from all the rest. Crouching down, you take a look at this peculiar fungi, and, comparing it to the mushrooms on the sign at the entrance to the Bat Caverns, you're certain that these are the ones that are edible.

		As you walk through the dark caverns, your footsteps causing the bioluminescent lichen underfoot to illuminate your way, you see a faint glimmer of light on the floor up ahead. Approaching this irregularity, you find that the light source is in fact a small cluster of glowing blue mushrooms. Crouching down, you take a look at this peculiar fungi, and, comparing it to the mushrooms on the sign at the entrance to the Bat Caverns, you're certain that these are the ones that are edible.

		As you travel through the underground mushroom forest, you see a splash of bright purple slime sprayed up the side of a nearby mushroom-tree. First glancing around to check that the slime who left this mark is long gone, you then take a step towards this purple goo in order to investigate further.
	</p>
	<p>
		As you approach, you see that there's a similar patch of glowing slime on the floor at the base of the tree, but unlike the goo splashed up the trunk, this slime is a bright orange. Beside this pool of orange goo, you see that one of the participants of what you assume to have been a sexual encounter has dropped a little package.
